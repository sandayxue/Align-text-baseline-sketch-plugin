# Align Text Baseline for Sketch

This plugin allows your text layers to be aligned vertically based on its font's baseline and cap height, not based on its frame.

The built in *Align Vertically* command works really bad for some fonts including most CJK fonts.

## Example

The right example is align vertically by frame (the built-in command), and it is not obviously what we want.
The left example is an output of this plugin.
